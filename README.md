# Los Angeles Declassified

The Los Angeles metropolitan area is the second largest in the United States. In the following exercises, I attempt to analyze the neighborhood using the information available
[FourSquare](https://foursquare.com/), a popular platform for learning about local businesses. The following project, delivered over Jupyter Notebook, uses K-Means Clustering
to group these neighborhoods by similarities. Libraries used include SciKitLearn, PyPlot, and NumPy.
